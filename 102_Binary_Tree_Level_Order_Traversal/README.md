    Problem:           Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
    Difficulty:        Medium
    Source:            https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/#/description

__Solution Step__:
 - `num` the count of nodes in the next level in current level, and initialized to be 1 if root is not a null pointer
 - so we can divide nodes into different level

[more concise](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/10469/c-solution-using-only-one-queue-use-a-marker-null/9) - `queue.size()` is the count of nodes exactly every while loop
